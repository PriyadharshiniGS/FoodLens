Food Calorie Count Tracking App—Project
 
Abstract :
The Food Calorie Count Tracking App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, 
designed to help users track their daily calorie intake seamlessly. The application allows users to log 
their meals manually or via image uploads, leveraging image recognition and nutritional databases 
to estimate calorie content. Users can set dietary goals, receive real-time insights, and monitor their 
progress over time. By integrating MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for 
backend APIs, and React.js for an intuitive frontend, the app provides a responsive and engaging 
user experience.

Objective :
• To develop a scalable and interactive calorie-tracking application using the MERN stack. 
• To enable users to log food entries manually or scan food images for automatic calorie 
estimation. 
• To integrate a food nutrition API (such as Spoonacular  API) for accurate calorie and nutrient 
breakdowns. 
• To provide real-time progress tracking, personalized meal suggestions, and goal setting. 
• To ensure secure user authentication and data privacy using JWT and bcrypt. 

Procedure :
1. Frontend Development (React.js) 
o Build a responsive UI with React.js, React Router, and Material-UI/Tailwind CSS. 
o Implement forms for manual food entry and an image upload feature. 
o Create a dashboard for tracking daily calorie intake and historical data. 
2. Backend Development (Node.js & Express.js) 
o Set up an Express.js server with API routes for user authentication, food entry 
logging, and calorie analysis. 
o Implement JWT-based authentication for secure login/signup. 
o Connect to a food nutrition API for retrieving calorie and nutrient data. 
3. Database Management (MongoDB) 
o Design MongoDB schemas for users, food logs, and user preferences. 
o Store user-specific data such as dietary goals, logged meals, and progress history. 
4. Integration of AI & Image Recognition (Optional - Machine Learning Module) 
o Integrate TensorFlow.js or a pre-trained image recognition model for detecting food 
items. 
o Train the model with labeled food images for calorie estimation. 
5. Testing & Deployment 
o Conduct unit and integration testing using Jest/Mocha. 
o Deploy the application using Vercel (Frontend) and Render/Heroku (Backend). 
o Use MongoDB Atlas for database hosting.
